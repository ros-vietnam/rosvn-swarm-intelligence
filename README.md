# ROS Vietnam – Swarm Intelligence & Multi-Agent Learning  
`rosvn-swarm-intelligence`

> **A research-grade repository for multi-agent swarm intelligence, coordination, and learning-based algorithms across heterogeneous robotic systems.**

---

## 1. Overview

**ROS Vietnam Swarm Intelligence** is the flagship research repository for **multi-agent robotics** within the ROS Vietnam ecosystem.

This repository focuses on:
- Swarm coordination algorithms
- Distributed multi-agent planning
- Learning-based collective intelligence
- Heterogeneous robot cooperation

Supported platforms include:
- AMR / UGV
- UAV
- USV
- Mixed-domain swarms

## 2. Why Swarm Robotics?

Single-robot autonomy does not scale.

Swarm robotics enables:
- Robustness through redundancy
- Scalability
- Distributed intelligence
- Emergent behaviors

> *The future of robotics is collective.*
